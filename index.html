          <h2>Data and Development Entusiast</h2>

          <p>
            I am currently a student at the University of Maryland - College Park
            studying information science. I have had the opportunity to work on 
            several projects using different technologies, such as Python,
            C, pandas, SQL, numpy, Tableau. Using these technologies exposed me to 
            learn different ways of solving problems. Therefore, I am currently
            looking for internships in the field of data, such as 
            data analytics, data management, data engineering.

            <h3>Data Story about Effects of Covid on the Economy</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on this project with two classmates, Abdul Mohamed and 
              Jude Scott. This was a capstone project for a data visualization
              course. In this project, I was responsible of analyzing whether
              there was a correlation between the Gross Domestic Product and 
              people movement, such as number of rides and miles driven.

            <h3>Nuclear Weapons Database Using MySQL</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on this project with three classmates. This was a capstone 
              project for a database design and modeling course. In this project,
              I acted as the chief designer of the database. I led all the design
              meetings, such as brainstorming information to store into tables,
              defining primary keys, and establishing relationship between tables.
              By the end of semester, the team was able to come up with a well
              designed database.
